Note : Divide the dataset into two parts i.e. Train and Validation 

# What is the Project?
This project is about classifying waste images into different categories using a machine learning model. It processes images of waste and predicts the type of waste they belong to.

# Algorithm and Technology it is using :
Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras
Techniques: Image preprocessing, data augmentation, supervised learning

# Model Performance Graphs
The training process generates two key plots:

Training and Validation Accuracy Curve: Shows how well the model is learning to classify images over 20 epochs.

Training and Validation Loss Curve: Shows how the modelâ€™s error reduces over time.


# Conclusion : 
This project is a waste classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.The model is trained on labeled images and provides predictions for new inputs, along with accuracy and loss graphs to evaluate performance. It helps automate waste sorting, making recycling more efficient and reducing manual effort. The outputs include predicted waste type, training visuals, and model summaries, making it useful for smart bins and recycling centers.
